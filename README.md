# Flow-Rate-Calculation-of-Vehicles-using-YOLO-
The Flow Rate Calculation of Vehicles using YOLO project, conducted by Nura Innovations, focused on improving traffic management through advanced image processing techniques. Utilizing the YOLO object detection algorithm, the team skillfully managed and analyzed traffic-cam datasets provided by the Indian police department to calculate and monitor the flow rates of various vehicle classes crossing designated tripwires over time. This system not only helped in the precise measurement of traffic volumes but also enhanced the overall traffic flow analysis through meticulous annotation of vehicle images and fine-tuning the model with the IDD detection dataset. The project achieved significant success by significantly reducing the error rate to just 3.5%, demonstrating a substantial improvement in matching the calculated flow rates with actual traffic conditions, thereby contributing effectively to smarter traffic management solutions.
